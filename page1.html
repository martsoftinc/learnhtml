        <h2>A little history about jollof</h2>
        <p>If you recently stumbled across what is loosely known as “African Twitter,” or other African social media spaces, you might have seen repeated mentions of Jollof rice. It’s a big deal, and a cause of endless banter for those on the continent, and in the diaspora.
            Jollof rice is a spiced dish, simmered in reduced tomatoes, onions, peppers, and different seasonings depending on where it’s made. It’s an iconic dish, with massive regional significance across West Africa and a staple in celebratory social gatherings, including at Lagos parties in Nigeria. The dark-orange spicy rice dish can be eaten by itself, but also be enjoyed along with side dishes, including fried plantains.
            On social media, the famous #JollofWars, a long-running smack talk contest between West Africans on who has the best version of the dish, has been brutal and merciless, with some international celebrities even weighing into the “battle”.</p>
